        "abstract": "Data will continue to play a significant role in sports from performance and player development to consumer engagement perspectives. Detailed accurate data collection has become more important and valuable as the sport has evolved. The industry stakeholders have no question about video content being a valuable source of data. An increasing amount of digital sports content is generated and made available through television broadcasts or streaming over the internet. However, the content is not used to its full potential due to the tedious work required to tag, curate, and extract value. Increased levels of data that teams and fans are interested in require an extensive and skilled team of operators and professionals to collect and analyze for broadcast and use by teams' coaching and analytics departments. The introduction of automation across the entire workflow of data collection, processing, curation, and maintenance has a significant impact on overcoming the challenges of data utilization from live sporting events and archived content. In this talk, we discuss AI applications across the entire workflow of data in sports, addressing the problem of automated tagging in a domain-specific software system built on computer vision and machine learning.",

        "title": "Exploiting Pre-trained Models, Compositionality, and Reasoning Algorithms for Visual-Language Object Placement",
        "abstract": "A major cost in building a system with machine learning is the cost of acquiring labeled data. In many tasks, we have multiple sources of information that can be utilized in order to reduce the amount of labeled data required. In this talk, we focus on using pre-trained or foundation models, using natural decomposition of the system, and exploiting known reasoning algorithms. We illustrate our approach using a visual-language task of object placement by following verbal instructions. In this task, we decompose the system into a natural language instruction parsing component, an object detection component, a grounding component that aligns the natural language with the visual objects and relations, and a reasoning component that infers the final position to place the target object. Each of these components are designed to be differentiable and can be composed into a larger differentiable system to facilitate learning by gradient descent. A pre-trained visual-language model is used to provide the visual and language embeddings for the objects and the system is trained end-to-end for the object placement task. We illustrate how the different sources of information reduce the amount of labeled data required for training the system.",
